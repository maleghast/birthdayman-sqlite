# BirthdayMan - a Toy App for managing birthday reminders

## Introduction

This is a "toy" app based on the app created by Dan Amber as part of an online video / tutorial about
[NBB](https://github.com/babashka/nbb) - here's a link to his [project](https://github.com/danownsthisspace/birthman)

In the spirit of trying to learn NBB for myself but get a flying start from Dan's excellent video, I decided
to change the DB tpo sqlite3 and to add another bit of data (what the person wants for their birthday), and
then add extra functionality to change the gift idea and to be able to search for birthdays on an arbitrary date.

[Here's a link to Dan's video](https://youtu.be/_-G9EKaAyuI) - The video is Dan coding and getting pair assistance
from the excellent [borkdude](https://github.com/borkdude), creator of Babashka and NBB amongst other awesome stuff
from the Clojure Ecosystem.
